      RESEARCH NOTES - HIDDEN FILESYSTEM SECRETS
      
      I've been documenting the anomalies in the system since the corruption began:
      
      1. Hidden Directories:
         - There appears to be a ghost_hidden directory that contains ancient system knowledge
         - The etc_hidden_configs room contains powerful configuration files that can enhance abilities
         - The archive contains crucial historical data, including a master key
         - The opt_mage_tower is perfect for those with arcane abilities
         - The tmp_hidden_chamber contains powerful temporary items, including keys
      
      2. Access Methods:
         - Some rooms require special keys
         - Others may only be accessible to specific character classes
         - Some may be completely hidden and require special knowledge to find
      
      3. Warning: The corruption is strongest in the core directory, where the daemon_overlord.sys resides.
      
      If you're reading this, be careful. Not all processes can be trusted...

      If you're reading this, I'm probably gone. The corruption has spread too far.
      I've hidden the master key in the archive, but it won't be easy to find.
      The Daemon Overlord guards the core. You'll need the backup to defeat it.
      Don't trust anything you see in /tmp - it's all illusions.
      Good luck. You'll need it.
