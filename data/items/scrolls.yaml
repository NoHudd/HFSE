      Remember that the Daemon Overlord has corrupted the system. Be cautious as you explore, and look for ways to cleanse the corruption!
      
      The core system is heavily protected. You'll need to find the master.key to access it.
      
      Good luck on your quest to save the filesystem!

      These commands were part of the original system before the modern interfaces.
      They hold great power when wielded by a true system administrator.
      
      chmod - Change file permissions
        chmod 777 file_name (full permissions)
        chmod 400 file_name (read-only)
        chmod 000 file_name (no permissions)
      
      grep - Search for patterns
        grep "pattern" file_name
        grep -r "pattern" directory_name
      
      awk - Text processing
        awk '{print $1}' file_name
      
      sed - Stream editor
        sed 's/old/new/g' file_name
      
      These commands may prove useful in maintaining the system now that
      you have defeated the corruption. Guard this knowledge well.
