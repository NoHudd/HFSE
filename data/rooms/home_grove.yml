description: A peaceful directory where user files mingle with natural system processes.
detailed_description: |
  The /home/grove directory is a surprising oasis of tranquility within the corrupted system. Here, user data has taken the form of lush digital foliage, creating a forest-like environment that seems to actively resist the corruption.
  
  Streams of clean data flow like healing springs, and the gentle hum of optimized processes creates a soothing atmosphere. This seems like a safe place to recover and prepare for more dangerous explorations.
  
  In the center of the grove stands a tall data structure resembling an ancient tree, its branches extending toward various user homes that appear as smaller clearings within the digital forest.
