name: Temporary Hidden Chamber
description: A secretive cache where powerful temporary items are stored.
detailed_description: |
  The /tmp directory has been transformed into a mysterious chamber filled with flickering, ephemeral treasures. Unlike other areas of the system, everything here seems to exist in a half-state, neither fully corrupted nor completely clean.
  
  Valuable resources and powerful artifacts hover in containment fields, each radiating with significant power. A warning etched in the wall reads: "All items here are temporary. Use them wisely before they are cleaned from memory."
  
  The air crackles with unstable energy - this place seems both valuable and potentially dangerous.
