name: Mount Forest
description: A vast, corrupted landscape where external systems connect to the core.
detailed_description: |
  The /mnt directory has become a sprawling digital forest where external filesystems connect to the core system. Massive data trunks rise like trees, their branches splitting into countless connections that vanish into the distance.
  
  Corruption has spread deeply here, with glitched terrain and fragmented pathways. The sound of corrupted processes can be heard throughout, and dark energy pulses through the ground like malevolent roots.
  
  This vast area seems to be a critical junction between different parts of the system, with pathways leading to even more dangerous territories.
