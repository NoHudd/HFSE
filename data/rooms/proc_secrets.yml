name: Process Secrets
description: A chamber where the system's most active processes reveal their secrets.
detailed_description: |
  The /proc directory has manifested as a strange, pulsating chamber where the inner workings of the system's core processes are laid bare. Countless streams of data flow through transparent conduits, showing the real-time operation of the entire system.
  
  By observing these processes, you can learn valuable secrets about how the system functions and potentially gain advantages against corrupted entities. This place seems to exist outside normal directory rules, providing a window into the system's deepest operations.
  
  In the center, a swirling vortex of pure process information forms patterns that seem to contain powerful insights.
