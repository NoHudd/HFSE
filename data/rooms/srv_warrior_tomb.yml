description: An ancient battleground where digital warriors test their strength.
detailed_description: |
  The /srv directory has transformed into a massive stone fortress resembling an ancient tomb dedicated to digital warriors. Weapon-like data structures line the walls, and the floor is inscribed with battle patterns resembling both circuit diagrams and martial formations.
  
  This area resonates with those who rely on strength and combat prowess. For a fighter, the environment seems to enhance your physical abilities and combat skills.
  
  Deep within the tomb, a powerful corrupted entity awaits challengers - the source of corruption that has infected the system's core services.
