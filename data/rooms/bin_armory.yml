name: Binary Armory
description: A directory filled with executable tools and corrupted binaries.
detailed_description: |
  The /bin directory has been transformed into a makeshift armory. Executable files hover in the air, pulsing with energy like weapons waiting to be wielded. The walls are lined with command structures that resemble racks of digital weaponry.
  
  Several corrupted processes patrol the area, their code visibly glitched and hostile. This appears to be where system tools have been weaponized by the corruption.
