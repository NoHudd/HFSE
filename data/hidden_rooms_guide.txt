The filesystem contains several hidden directories that don't appear in normal navigation. These secret areas contain powerful items and unique encounters that can significantly help your journey.

## How to Discover Hidden Rooms

1. **The /etc Configuration Room**
   - Hint found in: /usr/lib/arcane
   - Discovery method: Look for hidden files using `ls -a` in the Arcane Library
   - Clue text: "To find what's hidden, one must look at all, even that which seems invisible."
   - Once found, you can access via: `cd /etc/hidden_configs`

2. **The /dev/null Void**
   - Hint found in: /bin/armory
   - Discovery method: Examine the output of corrupt commands and look for void references
   - Execute the command: `find /dev -type f -name "null"`
   - Once found, you can access via: `cd /dev/null_void`

3. **The /proc Secrets Chamber**
   - Hint found in: /mnt/forest
   - Discovery method: Use `ps` or process-related commands when prompted by the lost_user.dat NPC

   - Once found, you can access via: `cd /proc/secrets`

## Rewards for Discovery

Each hidden room contains unique and powerful items:

## Additional Hidden Content

Throughout the filesystem, there are other secrets that can be discovered using Linux command knowledge:

1. Use `grep` to search for hidden passwords in text files
2. Try `cat` on seemingly insignificant files - they may contain crucial hints
3. The `find` command can reveal hidden paths and secret items
4. Some NPCs will provide extra information if you use the right commands in conversation

Remember: Exploration and clever use of Linux commands will be rewarded!
